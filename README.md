# Promise Generator

This project implements a promise generator using JavaScript, allowing users to create multiple promises with specified delays. The application utilizes the Notiflix library for user-friendly success and failure notifications.

## Features
- Users can input:
  - Initial delay (ms)
  - Delay increment (ms) per promise
  - Number of promises to generate
- Promises are resolved or rejected randomly.
- Notifications display the result of each promise using Notiflix.
